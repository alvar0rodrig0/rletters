### The short version

We use a third party provider to query your account with a third-party service, only for two purposes: (1) to ensure that you're logged in, and (2) to get your name and your e-mail.

We'll ask you to double-check that info when you sign up.  The only thing we ever do with your e-mail is send you messages about job completion.

We never see your password to your third-party account -- we just get notification that your login was successful.  No security issues to worry about!
