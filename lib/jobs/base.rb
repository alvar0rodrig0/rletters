# Code that runs as delayed jobs
#
# This module contains classes for all code that runs as a delayed job.
#
# Some guidelines for RLetters delayed jobs:
# - These jobs should, except in rare cases (like +DestroyDataset+) only
#   query Solr or the SQL database for something like 1,000 rows at a time.
#   Forgetting to put bounds on queries could result in fetching hundreds of
#   thousands of records from the database, possibly freezing up the DJ
#   worker for a period of days.
# - All of these jobs should derive from +Jobs::Base+ to enable error handling
#   and easy attribute setting and comparison.
# - Analysis jobs should derive from +Jobs::AnalysisJob+ to get some common
#   attributes.
module Jobs
  
  # Base class for all delayed jobs
  class Base
    
    # Initialize the job from a hash of attributes in a generic way
    #
    # This constructor will simply set all of the passed +args+ as attribute
    # values, if the job has the given attribute.
    #
    # @api public
    # @param [Hash] args the instance variables to set
    # @return [undefined]
    # @example Setting attributes in a job class
    #   class TestJob < Jobs::Base
    #     attr_accessor :name
