Customize the static content
----------------------------

For each of the following files, copy them from `<filename>.dist` to `<filename>`,
replacing their content with content appropriate for your application.  You may also
localize these static content files by making copies of, for example, 
`index.html.markdown` to `index.es.html.markdown`, `index.de.html.markdown`, and so
on.

-   `views/about/index.html.markdown.dist`: The "about us" page, linked from a button
    at the top of the homepage.
