= Installation and Setup

== Install Rails and the RLetters bundle

Configure Rails {in the usual manner,}[http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html] and check out a copy of RLetters.  Install the required gems for RLetters using <tt>bundle install</tt>.

== Set up a Solr server

Install Solr, using the schema provided at <tt>solr/schema.xml</tt>.  You may then populate the Solr database in the usual manner, sending documents formatted like the sample document provided at <tt>solr/sample-document.xml</tt>.  (In the sample document, the <tt>fulltext</tt> attribute is merely the abstract of the given article; you will want to replace this with the proper full-text of the document.)

== Customize application configuration

Copy the default configuration file from <tt>config/config.yml.dist</tt> to <tt>config/config.yml</tt> and edit it.  Modify the various variables to point to the URL of your Solr server, the various application name variables, and (optionally) a Google Analytics account and a {Mendeley Consumer API Key.}[http://dev.mendeley.com/]

== Customize the static content

For each of the following files, copy them from <tt><filename>.dist</tt> to <tt><filename></tt>, replacing their content with content appropriate for your application.  You may also localize these static content files by making copies of, for example, <tt>index.html.markdown</tt> to <tt>index.es.html.markdown</tt>, <tt>index.de.html.markdown</tt>, and so on.

-   <tt>views/about/index.html.markdown.dist</tt>: The "about us" page, linked from a button at the top of the homepage.
