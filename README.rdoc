= RLetters

Welcome to RLetters, an open-source Rails web application designed for the maintenance of a large database of academic journal articles.  Journal article content is stored in a {Solr}[http://lucene.apache.org/solr/] backend, and tools are provided to perform various text-mining and digital humanities work on the article text.

RLetters is developed by the Digital Humanities Working Group at the University of Notre Dame.  The lead developer is {Charles Pence.}[http://charlespence.net]  The source to RLetters is freely available under the MIT License, and is {hosted at GitHub.}[http://github.com/cpence/rletters]


== Features

* Maintain a large index of academic journal publications.
* "Web-application" interface built with {jQuery Mobile}[http://jquerymobile.com], accessible on the desktop, tablet devices, and smartphones.  Advanced integration available with Apple iOS devices.
* Complex full-text searching of this index using the search facilities provided by {Solr}[http://lucene.apache.org/solr/] (and its underlying {Lucene}[http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/index.html] engine).
* Export your database in a variety of export formats (RIS, EndNote, RefWorks, BibTeX, MARC, MARCXML, MODS, etc.).
* {unAPI}[http://unapi.info/] support for connecting with bibliography managers like {Zotero.}[http://www.zotero.org]
* Advanced text-mining tools, including term frequency information, term concordances, etc. (This is the current active area of RLetters development, much more powerful text-mining tools will be added in the next several versions.)


== Get RLetters

Currently, the only way to retrieve the RLetters source is to {check out a copy from our GitHub repository.}[http://github.com/cpence/rletters]  RLetters is under active development -- anything can (and will!) break at any time.


== Installation and Setup

=== Install Rails and the RLetters bundle

Configure Rails {in the usual manner,}[http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html] and check out a copy of RLetters.  Install the required gems for RLetters using <tt>bundle install</tt>.

=== Set up a Solr server

Install Solr, using the schema provided at <tt>solr/schema.xml</tt>.  You may then populate the Solr database in the usual manner, sending documents formatted like the sample document provided at <tt>solr/sample-document.xml</tt>.  (In the sample document, the <tt>fulltext</tt> attribute is merely the abstract of the given article; you will want to replace this with the proper full-text of the document.)

=== Customize application configuration

Copy the default configuration file from <tt>config/config.yml.dist</tt> to <tt>config/config.yml</tt> and edit it.  Modify the various variables to point to the URL of your Solr server, the various application name variables, and (optionally) a Google Analytics account and a {Mendeley Consumer API Key.}[http://dev.mendeley.com/]

=== Customize the static content

For each of the following files, copy them from <tt><filename>.dist</tt> to <tt><filename></tt>, replacing their content with content appropriate for your application.  You may also localize these static content files by making copies of, for example, <tt>index.html.markdown</tt> to <tt>index.es.html.markdown</tt>, <tt>index.de.html.markdown</tt>, and so on.

-   <tt>views/about/index.html.markdown.dist</tt>: The "about us" page, linked from a button at the top of the homepage.

Now you've got some images to customize.

-   First, <tt>public/images/error-watermark.png</tt>.  This is an image shown in the bottom-left corner of the site's error pages (as well as the page shown to web-app users when they attempt to access RLetters without an internet connection).  Something like 500x300 pixels is a good size for this image.
-   Now, the iOS splash images and icons:
    -   <tt>h/apple-touch-icon.png</tt>: 114x114 pixel iOS application icon.  This is used on Retina Display-capable iPhones.
    -   <tt>m/apple-touch-icon.png</tt>: 72x72 pixel iOS application icon.  This is used on the iPad.
    -   <tt>l/apple-touch-icon.png</tt> and <tt>l/apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png</tt>: 57x57 pixel iOS application icon.  This is used on low-resolution iPhone and iPod Touch devices.
    -   <tt>h/splash.png</tt>: 768x1004 splash screen, displayed while loading the app on retina-display iPhone devices.
    -   <tt>l/splash.png</tt>: 320x460 splash screen, displayed while loading the app on low-resolution iPhone and iPod Touch devices.

=== Ready to go!

Now youâ€™re ready to roll!
