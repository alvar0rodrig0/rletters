== Features

=== Support for web and library standards

RLetters provides support for the following web and library standards:

-   {unAPI}[http://unapi.info] for automatic bibliographic data retrieval
    from individual documents
-   {WorldCat OpenURL Registry}[http://www.oclc.org/developer/services/worldcat-registry] for detection of the OpenURL resolver of the user's local library

And you can export bibliographic data in the following standard formats:

-   {MARC 21 transmission format}[http://www.loc.gov/marc/]
-   {MARCXML}[http://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/]
-   {MARC-JSON (draft)}[http://www.oclc.org/developer/content/marc-json-draft-2010-03-11]
-   {MODS}[http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/]
-   {RDF/XML}[http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/] (using {Dublin Core Grammar}[http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-citation-guidelines/])
-   {RDF/N3}[http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3.html] (using {Dublin Core Grammar}[http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-citation-guidelines/])
-   {BibTeX}[http://www.ctan.org/pkg/bibtex]
-   {EndNote (ENW format)}[http://www.endnote.com/]
-   {Reference Manager (RIS format)}[http://www.refman.com/support/risformat_intro.asp]


== Installation

=== Install and configure Solr

You will need to install and set up Solr yourself before you begin.  RLetters provides snippets from both <tt>schema.xml</tt> and <tt>solrconfig.xml</tt>, which define the document schema and the request handlers that are used by RLetters.  Of course, you are welcome to add, edit, or change these as necessary.

=== Install Rails and some gems

We'll assume for these instructions that you know how to {install Ruby on Rails}[http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html] and get a Rails application up and running on your local web server.  Install the various gems required for RLetters by executing <tt>bundle install</tt>.

=== Set up some configuration files

Set up the required configuration files:

-   Copy <tt>config/database.yml.dist</tt> to <tt>config/database.yml</tt>, and edit it to point to your database.
-   Copy <tt>config/app_config.yml.dist</tt> to <tt>config/app_config.yml</tt>, and edit it to include your application's details.

User login for RLetters uses the external {Janrain Engage}[http://www.janrain.com/products/engage] service, which allows users to log in through Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, and a number of other third-party services.  For user login to work properly, you will need to create a Janrain Engage account at their website (free for less than 2,500 users per year, which should be more than enough for an academic resource like RLetters).  Once you've created an account, click "Sign-In for Websites" on the right-hand side, and configure your login widget.  Under "Application Settings," make sure to add your deployment URL to the Domain Whitelist.  Add a link to your privacy policy ((YOUR URL)/info/privacy), and your favicon.  Now open <tt>config/app_config.yml</tt>.  The value for <tt>janrain_appname</tt> is the subdomain under Application Domain (e.g., for rletters.rpxnow.com, the <tt>janrain_appname</tt> is <tt>rletters</tt>).  Copy the value for "App ID" as <tt>janrain_appid</tt>, and the value for "API Key (Secret)" as <tt>janrain_secret</tt>.

If you would like your users to be able to search for document results on {Mendeley}[http://www.mendeley.com], you will need to visit the {Mendeley Developers Portal}[http://dev.mendeley.com] and register your application.  Take the value of your "Consumer Key" and paste it into <tt>config/app_config.yml</tt> as <tt>mendeley_key</tt>.

Obviously, make sure to secure your <tt>config/app_config.yml</tt> file.

=== Customize some static content

Several files have some long-format text about your application that you'll want to customize.

-   <tt>app/views/info/_privacy_short.markdown</tt> and <tt>app/views/info/_privacy_long.markdown</tt>:  We've filled this in with a pretty good default privacy policy for the default settings of RLetters.  If you change the way that you interact with your users, you should update this privacy policy.
-   <tt>app/views/datasets/_no_datasets.markdown</tt>: This message is displayed to users when they log in for the first time (and don't have any datasets).  You'll want to customize it to tell users a little more about your application.

Now you've got some images to customize.

-   <tt>app/assets/images/error-watermark.png</tt>: This is an image shown in the bottom-left corner of the site's error pages (as well as the page shown to web-app users when they attempt to access RLetters without an internet connection).  Something like 500x300 pixels is a good size for this image.
-   Now, the iOS splash images and icons:
    -   <tt>images/h/apple-touch-icon.png</tt>: 114x114 pixel iOS application icon.  This is used on Retina Display-capable iPhones.
    -   <tt>images/m/apple-touch-icon.png</tt>: 72x72 pixel iOS application icon.  This is used on the iPad.
    -   <tt>images/l/apple-touch-icon.png</tt> and <tt>l/apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png</tt>: 57x57 pixel iOS application icon.  This is used on low-resolution iPhone and iPod Touch devices.
    -   <tt>images/h/splash.png</tt>: 768x1004 splash screen, displayed while loading the app on retina-display iPhone devices.
    -   <tt>images/l/splash.png</tt>: 320x460 splash screen, displayed while loading the app on low-resolution iPhone and iPod Touch devices.
- Finally, <tt>public/favicon.ico</tt>, the standard favorite icon.

If you'd like, you can update the {humans.txt}[http://humanstxt.org] file at <tt>public/humans.txt</tt>.
