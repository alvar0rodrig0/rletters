TODO
----

- Locale system
  - Implement a user settings page with a locale switcher
  - Wrap all the UI in translate calls
- Public release?
  - Figure out how to put a copy of the Solr schema into the
    Git repository
  - Abstract all the user-provided static content somehow (how
    do other open source Rails projects deal with this?)
- Come up with something intelligent to do with the flashes.
  Could I redirect them into a JQM dialog box somehow?
- Figure out how to save/edit user definable parameters, such
  as locale, documents-per-page, etc. (are there more of these
  than that, or should there be?)
