TODO
----

- Locale system
  - Implement a user settings page with a locale switcher
- Come up with something intelligent to do with the flashes.
  Could I redirect them into a JQM dialog box somehow?
- Figure out how to save/edit user definable parameters, such
  as locale, documents-per-page, etc. (are there more of these
  than that, or should there be?)
