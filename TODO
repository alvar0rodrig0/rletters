TODO
----

- Proper help system with localized help messages
- For all but the front page, can/should I strip down the HTML
  to a minimal layout?  Saves bandwidth, but does it cause any
  other problems?
- Locale system
  - Implement a user settings page with a locale switcher
  - Wrap all the UI in translate calls
- Public release?
  - Figure out how to put a copy of the Solr schema into the
    Git repository
  - Abstract all the user-provided static content somehow (how
    do other open source Rails projects deal with this?)
