*   Check that everywhere that has required: true has .invalid-feedback with validation_errors_for
*   Float all submit buttons to the right of their forms

*   Standardize capitalization and wahtnot on all of our validation errors, they're a mess
*   Standardize e-mail vs email
*   Consider implementing papertrail for logging all changes to user data and where they came from (a GDPR "should" but not a "must")

*   New admin panel:
    -   Need to be able to edit:
        +   CSL styles
        +   Custom pages
