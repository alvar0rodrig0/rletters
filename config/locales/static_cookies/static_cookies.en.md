# Cookies

To make this site work properly, we sometimes place small data files called cookies on your device. Most big websites do this too.

### What are cookies?

A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.

### How do we use cookies?

We use cookies only to determine whether or not you are logged into your user account. These cookies are deleted when you end your browser session, unless you check "Remember me" when you log in -- if you do that, we will create a cookie that identifies you for the next two weeks and keeps you from having to log in again.

### How to control cookies

You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish – for details, see <https://aboutcookies.org>. You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities may not work.
