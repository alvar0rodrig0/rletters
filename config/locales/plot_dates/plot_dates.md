## Plot a dataset by date

#### This analysis job takes a single dataset and plots it by publication date.

This job results in a graph of the publication dates of your dataset, as well as the counts downloadable as a CSV file.  When the graph is computed, you may optionally choose to divide the absolute counts of articles published in a given year by the counts in another dataset or in the entire corpus, giving you the *fraction* of articles in the larger set which appear in your search.  By simply counting the publication frequency over time, you can actually answer a wide variety of questions:

> How has the frequency of use of a term changed over time? *(Input: a dataset created from a search for a single term)*
>
> How much of the literature in a given time period was focused on a given topic? *(Input: a dataset created from a search for this topic, normalizing against the entire corpus)*
