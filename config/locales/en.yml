        This page lets you perform an advanced search of the article database.
        You may choose either to utilize our guided search form, or to 
        construct a query directly in [Solr's query 
        syntax](http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrQuerySyntax), 
        which is itself a superset of [Lucene query 
        syntax](http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_9_1/queryparsersyntax.html).
        These custom searches are extremely powerful.
