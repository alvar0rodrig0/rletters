## Plot the use of a term by date

#### This analysis job takes a single dataset and plots the occurrences of a term within it by date.

This job results in a graph of the occurrences of the given term within your dataset, plotted by date, as well as those occurrences downloadable as a CSV file.  This allows us to answer a wide variety of questions:

> How has the frequency of use of a term changed over time? *(Input: a dataset of interest, plotting for the use of a given term)*
>
> When was a term first introduced into the literature? *(Input: a dataset of interest, looking for the place when the term is first introduced)*
> 
> How has a term moved through the literature? *(Input: comparing these graphs for the same term across different journals and time periods)*
