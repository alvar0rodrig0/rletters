## Extract references to proper nouns

#### This analysis job looks through a set of texts and extracts all instances of proper names.

Using the [Stanford Named Entity Recognizer (NER),](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml) this task will read through a set of texts and extract any references that it can find to persons, organizations, places, and other proper names.  References to persons and organizations will produce links to Wikipedia pages, and references to places will both link to Wikipedia and be placed on a map.

The accuracy of the NER is lower than might be desired, but this job can provide an interesting way to begin exploring the following kinds of questions:

> What organizations are commonly correlated with certain kinds of research?
>
> What locations do researchers in a given field usually work or live in?
>
> Have regions of foucus in a body of literature changed over time?
