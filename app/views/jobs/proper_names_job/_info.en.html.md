## Extract references to proper nouns

#### This analysis job looks through a set of texts and extracts all instances of proper names.

This task will read through a set of texts and extract any references that it can find to proper names, such as those of persons, organizations, and places. The accuracy of the proper name extractor is lower than might be desired, but this job can provide an interesting way to begin exploring the following kinds of questions:

> What organizations are commonly correlated with certain kinds of research?
>
> What locations do researchers in a given field usually work or live in?
>
> Have regions of focus in a body of literature changed over time?
