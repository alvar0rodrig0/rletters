# About evoText

The evoText website is designed to let users perform full-text searches and utilize extensive text-mining tools to analyze the journal literature in the evolutionary sciences.

### What are the evolutionary sciences?

We mean, broadly, all sciences which utilize evolutionary theory as a key component.  This includes evolutionary biology itself, other areas of the biological sciences, as well as evolutionarily-focused areas of anthropology, psychology, philosophy, and even economics and literature.

### What are text-mining tools?

[Text mining](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining) is a process by which computer analysis may be used to extract information about texts, particularly information of a type or scale that makes such information inaccessible to traditional reading.  For example, using our database, one may query information about the frequency or occurrence of a given term over time in thousands of journal articles, a research task which would be next to impossible via reading each individual article.

### Is this legal?

The full-text of the articles we make available for searching is _not_ available directly through the evoText website.  In order to access the full text of articles, you must have access to them through the publisher, either via a purchased personal subscription or access from a library.

The fair use doctrine for academic purposes is described in [Copyright Circular 21](www.copyright.gov/circs/circ21.pdf), “Reproduction of Copyrighted Works by Educators and Librarians.”  Quoting from that document, “the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction... for purposes such as...scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.”  Fair use claims are evaluated based upon “the purpose and character of the use”, “the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole”, and “the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.”

In the case of evoText, we are using these documents for nonprofit educational purposes, and no more than small snippets, far less than the fair-use standard of 500 words, of the full document text may be retrieved through our service.  This falls far short of the definition of “systematic copying” developed in the discussion of the fair use doctrine.  Further, we believe that the market for journal articles is indeed _increased_ by the availability of high-quality search tools for such articles, as evidenced by the extensive collaboration between journal publishers and entities like Google and PubMed.

### Who runs this operation?

The evoText website has been developed by a team of researchers at the [University of Notre Dame](http://www.nd.edu/).  The lead developer is [Charles Pence](http://charlespence.net), and the research team consists of Charles Pence, [Grant Ramsey](http://grantramsey.com), and [Agustin Fuentes](http://anthropology.nd.edu/faculty-staff/fuentes_agustin/index.shtml).  We have also benefited from an internal grant provided by the university to the Notre Dame Digital Humanities Working Group, which includes the evoText team as well as [Eric Lease Morgan](http://www.nd.edu/~emorgan/) and [Sean T. O’Brien](http://seantobrien.wordpress.com/).  Further invaluable assistance has been provided by Notre Dame’s [Center for Research Computing.](http://crc.nd.edu)

**Notice: Warning Concerning Copyright Restrictions**

The copyright law of the United States (title 17, United States Code) governs the making of photocopies or other reproductions of copyrighted material.
Under certain conditions specified in the law, libraries and archives are authorized to furnish a photocopy or other reproduction. One of these specified conditions is that the photocopy or reproduction is not to be “used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship, or research.” If a user makes a request for, or later uses, a photocopy or reproduction for purposes in excess of “fair use,” that user may be liable for copyright infringement.

This institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying order if, in its judgment, fulfillment of the order would involve violation of copyright law.
