# A generated file, stored for the user to download
#
# A download object is generated when a delayed job needs to send some data
# back to the user.  We keep track of them in the database so that they can
# be expired and deleted when necessary.
#
# All files are stored in +RAILS_ROOT/downloads+, *not* in the +public+ tree,
# so that it is impossible to get the web server to serve the download files
# without passing through the RLetters's authentication. This folder is
# expected to be symlinked over from +shared+ during a Capistrano deployment.
class Download < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :filename, :presence => true
  # :filename_before_type_cast gives you the value of the filename attribute
  # without passing it through our custom accessor, which turns the relative
  # database path into an absolute filesystem path.
